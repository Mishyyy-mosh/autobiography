        <p>Hi! I'm Mishka Sophia Dahunan. Here's my story.</p>
        <p>I was born on June 12, 2008, in the City of Golden Friendship — Cagayan de Oro City. Growing up, life had its bright days, but also its dark seasons. It wasn’t always easy, and that's something I'm not afraid to admit.</p>
        <p>During the pandemic, I went through a tough time. I felt lost, disconnected, disappointed, and deeply sad. It was a quiet kind of sadness — the kind you carry in silence. I didn’t know how to express it, and for a while, I just kept it all inside. But through that experience, I started to slowly understand myself more.</p>
        <p>Growing up, I’ve always been curious and creative in the smallest ways. I love exploring new things, expressing myself through art and crafts, and finding joy in simple moments. One of the biggest things that shaped me is crocheting — it’s not just a hobby, it’s how I relax, express myself, and make thoughtful gifts for others.</p>
        <p>I'm also someone who values peace and kindness. I prefer calm environments, but I also enjoy deep conversations, fun bonding moments, and learning about different people and perspectives. Whether it’s through school, my interests, or everyday life, I always try to be genuine and mindful.</p>
        <p>As a student, I do my best to stay focused and motivated. As I was once a disappointment, I believe in working hard — but also in taking care of my mental health and knowing when to rest. Life isn’t perfect, but every day is a chance to grow and become a better version of myself.</p>

        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Crocheting</strong> – It's my safe space. I love making little plushies, accessories, and gifts. Each project feels like a quiet reminder that something beautiful can come out of patience and care.</li>
            <li><strong>Watching movies and series</strong> – I enjoy stories that make me think or feel deeply. Whether it's a drama, mystery, or slice-of-life, movies help me escape and reflect at the same time.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploring tech</strong> – I like discovering how apps work, understanding gadgets, and learning little things about coding. It fascinates me how something digital can be built with logic and creativity.</li>
            <li><strong>Journaling</strong> – Writing my thoughts down helps me cope, reflect, and stay grounded. It's like talking to myself without judgment.</li>
            <li><strong>Listening to music</strong> – Music helps me express feelings I can’t put into words. My playlists are full of emotional, chill, and meaningful songs that keep me company during both happy and sad moments.</li>
            <li><strong>Learning new skills</strong> – Whether it's drawing, editing, or trying digital art, I enjoy experimenting and picking up small creative hobbies.</li>
            <li><strong>Spending time alone</strong> – I value solitude. Quiet moments help me recharge and reconnect with myself.</li>
            <li><strong>Bonding with people I trust</strong> – I'm quiet around many, but when I'm with people I feel safe with, I enjoy laughing, sharing stories, and making memories.</li>
            <li><strong>Taking photos</strong> – I like capturing moments that feel meaningful, even the little things. Whether it’s nature, random objects, or candid selfies, photography helps me see beauty in the ordinary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Travels</h2>
        <p>I love visiting new places, even if it's just somewhere simple or close by. My favorite trip so far has been to <strong>Bukidnon</strong>. It wasn’t super fancy or anything, but the view was amazing and the air felt so fresh — it gave me peace.</p>
        <p>We stayed near the mountains, and I still remember how cold the morning was and how quiet everything felt. It’s those simple moments I enjoyed the most. I took a lot of pictures, but some of the best memories are the ones I didn’t capture with a camera.</p>
        <p>I don’t get to travel often, but when I do, I like just being present — no pressure, no rush, just enjoying what’s around me. Someday, I hope to visit Baguio or even outside the country, but for now, I’m happy with small trips that make me feel alive and calm.</p>

            <h3>How I Started Crocheting</h3>
            <p>It all began when there was a free dental service in <strong>Calaanan or Camaman-an</strong> during the pandemic. I was bored and honestly just looking for anything to keep my mind off things. I noticed a group of elderly women doing something interesting, so I decided to take a look.</p>
            <p>They were kind and very willing to teach. I decided to give it a try. At first, I didn’t know how to do anything, but as I watched and listened to how they taught me — with patience and kindness — I gave my best.</p>
            <p>My first few attempts were a mess — uneven stitches, tangles, and a lot of frustration. But for some reason, I didn’t give up. I kept practicing, and slowly, my hands got used to the rhythm. I looked down and realized I had actually made something... something small, but mine.</p>
            <p>Since then, crocheting has become more than just a hobby. It's my way of expressing myself and coping with stress. Each plushie or piece I finish makes me feel calm, proud, and even a little healed. It's quiet, but it means a lot to me.</p>
